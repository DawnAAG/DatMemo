15th may changed the buttons to navigationlinks, so I can use them to transfer views
Actually I made I change in plan, I want to make first the logic on the login, cat choosing and then making the design of the main page, as I will forgive what I wanted, Lol, which is kinda funny, but anyway, I really want to do the logic for the login and catchoosing faster so I can understand more in the near future, but Idk how it will help me, because further is kinda different from what is is now, example the calendar and the choosing logic, which is kidna easy in comparison to calendar AND of course the sending of the ready product, but we will see...
For now I made the first steps for formatting the "brain" of our app, hahaha
